Currently serving as the governor of New Mexico, Richardson's been in the game way longer than you have and will help you quell the concerns many have of your experience and Foreign Policy expertise. Beginning his career in 1983 as a house representative for New Mexico, Richardson went on to serve as the Un Ambassador and later Secretary of Energy for the Clinton administration before being elected governor of New Mexico in 2002 and winning reelection in 06 by a wide margin. Billy also made a name for himself for accompanying the State Department on diplomatic visits to North Korea in the 90s, successfully negotiating the release of an American prisoner. Richardson's presence on the ticket would greatly excite Latino communities in Florida and the Southwest, a constituency Bush did surprisingly well with in 2004. Selecting the first ever non-white running mate can also help serve as an olive-branch to dejected Obama supporters and other minorities in General.<br><br>Richardson is not without his fair share of faults however, his race being the definition of a double-edged sword. While your Southern roots and populist campaign will keep many at bay, Southern and even  some Midwestern Whites will feel uncomfortable such a <i>swarthy</i> presence on the ticket. Richardson is also quite frankly not on the best terms with you, during his short-lived primary campaign he criticized how you and Obama attacked Clinton, and went on to support Hillary over you in the Primary after dropping out. There's also been rumours of a much more sinful side to Richardson hiding underneath his warm exterior, whispers of womanizing, corruption, and hush money.
